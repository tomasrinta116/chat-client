# Channels Overview

This folder contains all of the files and components for the Channels screen. This is the landing page for a user once they login, and presents them with the ability to select a pre-existing channel and redirect to that channel's chat interface, or create a new channel. 

All channels in the current version of this app are open. This means that anyone can access them and chat. However, only a creator of a channel or an admin can ultimately delete a channel.
